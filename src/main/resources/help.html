<body><h1>GeoGit Repository Browser</h1>
<p>This tool is intended as a tool for assisting a developer making ad hoc verifications of the content of a development repository. 
This tool is useful for tracking down the current state of a repository and the data that it contains. It is not designed nor currently intended for large datasets.
As all features are currently displayed in the tree, this could get infeasible quickly. A more robust solution would be to display in a pageable or 
filterable table where the descriptions are currently shown.
<h2>Data View</h2>

<p>
This subtree represents a data centric view of the current working directory and uses the GeoGit DataStore and FeatureCollections to query data. 
</p>
<h2>Working Tree</h2>
<p>
This subtree is built by using the underlying Repository class and more closely represents the actual physical structure of the Repository.
</p>
<h3>HEAD</h3>
<p>This is the structure of the current checkout. HEAD > {NAMESPACE} > FEATURETYPE > FEATURE
<h3>Commits</h3>
<p>This is a linear list of all of the commits starting at the current head and finishing with the initial commit.
<h3>Branches</h3>
<p>These are the current branches defined in the Repository's config.
<h3>Remotes</h3>
<p>These are the current remotes defined in the Repository's config.
